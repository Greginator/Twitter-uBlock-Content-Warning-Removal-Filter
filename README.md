# Twitter Content Warning Removal Filter for uBlock Origin

## How to Install
1. Go to uBlock origin settings page
2. Click important and append
3. Select filter.txt

Alternative
1. Go to uBlock origin settings page
2. Copy and paste the contents of filter.txt at the bottom of your "My Filters" page

## Why?

Twitter has begun aggressively marking all content from users it seems to be "sensitive" with a content warning even if the content in question isn't sensitive at all.

I saw lots of scripts using Stylus or ViolentMonkey to do this but none using uBlock Origin which is much more widely used by people already for privacy and tracking protection.
