## Why?

Twitter has begun aggressively marking all content from users it deems to be "sensitive" with a content warning even if the content in question isn't sensitive at all.

While a lot of scripts were using Stylus or ViolentMonkey to do this, I saw none using uBlock Origin which is much more widely used for privacy and tracking protection.
